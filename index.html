        <h1>Wonderful World</h1>
        <h3>by Frank Sinatra</h3>
        <p>It's a wonderful world, <br> 
            I'm just walkin' on air!<br> 
            Talk of heaven on earth,<br> 
            I've got more than my share!<br> 
            Haven't got a care,<br> 
            Happy all day through,<br> 
            It's a wonderful world<br> 
            Loving wonderful you!<br>         
        </p>
        <p>
          from album Swing Along with Me, 1961 [w. Billy May & his Orch.]

        <h1>My Way</h1>
        <p>And now the end is here<br>
           And so I face that final curtain<br>
           My friend I'll make it clear<br>
           I'll state my case, of which I'm certain<br>
           I've lived a life that's full<br>
           I traveled each and every highway<br>
           And more, much more<br>
           I did it, I did it my way<br>
        </p>
    </body>
